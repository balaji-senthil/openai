## 📖 Overview

This project explores and implements agent-based AI systems using OpenAI's platform. The long-term goal is to develop a deep understanding of agent architectures and create reusable components that can be integrated into other projects.

## 🎯 Long-term Goals

- 📚 Learn and understand OpenAI's agent architecture and capabilities
- 🔧 Create custom agents for specific use cases and domains
- 🔄 Integrate agents into other projects and workflows
- 🧩 Experiment with multi-agent systems and orchestration
- 🔬 Research best practices for agent design and implementation

## 🚀 Features

- Agent-based architecture with specialized roles
- Handoff system for intelligent task routing
- Guardrails for safe and controlled agent behavior
- Async execution for efficient processing
- Modular design for easy integration

## 💡 Use Cases

- 🎓 Educational assistants and tutoring
- 🔍 Research and information gathering
- ⚙️ Workflow automation
- 📝 Content generation and curation
- 💬 Conversational interfaces
- 🛠️ Tool-using agents

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- [OpenAI's agent framework](https://platform.openai.com/)
- Python async programming
- Pydantic for data validation
- Jupyter for interactive development

## 🏗️ Project Structure

└── (future modules)  # Additional agent components and examples
```

## 🚦 Getting Started

1. Set up a Python virtual environment
2. Install dependencies: `pip install openai-agents nest_asyncio`
3. Create a `.env` file with your OpenAI API key
4. Run the Jupyter notebook: `jupyter notebook play.ipynb`

## 📋 Current Examples

- Multi-agent system with triage and specialist agents
- Guardrails for content filtering
- Async execution patterns

## 🔮 Future Directions

- Tool-using agents for accessing external systems
- Memory systems for long-term context
- Multi-modal agent interactions
- Fine-tuning for specialized domains
- Agent evaluation framework
